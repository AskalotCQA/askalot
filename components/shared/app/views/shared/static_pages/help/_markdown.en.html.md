You can use Markdown in texts of questions, answers and comments. The implementation is compatibile with [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) (click for more information about how to format your text).

### Linking questions

Questions can be referred after typing `#` followed by identificator of a question (e.g. `#1` refers to `id = 1`). When you write an identificator, title of the question will be added automatically.

### Linking users

In Markdown texts you can refer to other users. After typing `@` start writing a nick of a user. Autocomplete will assist you.

### Gemoji icons

In Markdown texts it is possible to add funny icons Gemoji. After typing `:` you will see a list of Gemojis icons that you can search by name (e.g. `:beer:` :beer:). You can find complete list of Gemojis here: [Emoji cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com).

## MathJax

Additionally, you can use [TeX syntax](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) to embed math formulas. Use `$formula$` or `\\(formula\\)` syntax to include inline math expressions, and `$$formula$$` or `\\[formula\\]` to include block level math expressions.
