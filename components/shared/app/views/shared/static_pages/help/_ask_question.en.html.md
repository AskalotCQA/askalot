How to ask a new question properly to get the best answer as quickly as possible? Here are few tips how to do it.

### Category

Choosing the right category helps to answer your question faster. Questions are organized into topics based on the right category. These topics can be watched by individual experts in the area.

### How to fill the title?

The title of the question briefly and clearly describes the topic you are going to ask about. Keep the title interesting to get quick and good answers.

### How to fill the text of a question?

You need to ask the question concisely. Explain the context and get directly to the root of a problem. Include your knowledge about the problem and use [Markdown](<%= help_path anchor: :markdown %>) to structure the text or [Gemojis](<%= help_path anchor: :markdown %>) to express your emotions :dancer:

### Tags

To route your question to the right people as quickly as possible, you need to assign it corresponding tags. This is the most important step for correct classification of your question! There are some tags in the system, and they are auto-completed during writting of the text. If your tag already exists do not make a new one, please (e.g. rails vs. ruby-on-rails). Correct tags shall complete your question. Other users use tags in order to find or answer the questions with similar topic.

### If the question is answered

To store knowledge and solved problems it is important to mark the best answer.

<%= help_image_tag 'label-answer-as-best-en.png' %>

### I made a mistake!

If you want to edit your question, click on <%= icon_tag :edit %>, and you can change the text of your question. However, the meaning of your question should not be changed! If you add a new text to the question, put the keyword `edit:` and next to it you can write what is missing. It will be clear to everyone what is your update on the question.
