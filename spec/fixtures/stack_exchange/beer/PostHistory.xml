Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term &quot;top-fermenting&quot; is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. *&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as &quot;bottom&quot; yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(all information from http://beeradvocate.com/)" />

(Technically you can re-carbonate flat beer!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Natural carbonation - All beer has SOME yeast present. Home-brewers that bottle will actually pour a little bit of sugar into the racked beer before bottling. The yeast that is present will re-activate and eat the sugar. One of the bi-products is CO2. Because the beer is bottled and the CO2 has nowhere to go, it will dissolve into solution.

Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name *porter* came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that *porter* simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another theory suggests that *porter* comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called *poorter* was being made as early as the 1300s.

For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Entire* was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name *porter* came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that *porter* simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another theory suggests that *porter* comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called *poorter* was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term *poorter* originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I would guess this is primarily how it's done, but there could be other (post-fermentation) processes of removing alcohol.

I like many higher-alcohol beers because the alcohol seems to bring out many of the more complex flavours in the beer, making it (in my opinion) more interesting. That's not to say that all strong beers are good or all light beers are bad, as there are many other things to consider.

The first big distinction is ales versus lagers. Lagers are stored in cold rooms during the production process, and I find they're lighter on average than ales, certainly in terms of flavour, and often in terms of colour as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After that, there are lots of less-black-and-white brewing differences between styles of beer. For example, IPAs generally have a considerable amount of hops added, but that's not always true. Hefeweizen has considerable amounts of yeast left after brewing, giving it its cloudy appearance. The list goes on and on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I think that the traditional names for beer styles (stout, lager, IPA, wheat beer, etc.) are based a lot on brewing process, and in the case of something like lager or wheat beer, the name clearly shows the brewing origin. However, more and more brewers are pushing the boundaries of these styles, so when it comes to things like appearance and flavour, which are ultimately the things that matter, two beers from different brewing styles can be quite similar, or two beers from the same brewing style can be quite different." />

This [1953 analysis by a chemist in the Carlsberg research laboratory][1] has all the gory details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Normal brewing yeast has enzymes that break down glucose and fructose, [but not lactose][2]. This kind of yeast evolved on rotting fruit, where there is plenty of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but no lactose, so they never needed the enzymes. There are [other yeasts which can ferment lactose][3], but they aren't used in brewing, except by zany vodka makers and Mongols.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in a normal beer, potentially all of the sugar can be broken down during brewing. Whether it is or not is up to the brewer, who can stop the process while sugar remains, or let it run to completion. However, in a milk stout, there is no way for the lactose to be broken down, so it all remains at the end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The amount of lactose in a milk stout varies, but it seems that it is likely to be in the range of [5 to 13%][4]; that is, in a (568 millilitre) pint, there may be anywhere from 28 to 74 grams of lactose.

Popsci has a LOT of cool beer articles. Fractional freezing is the best way to increase the alcohol content of beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fractional freezing -- &quot;jacking&quot; in old parlance -- has a long history in the United States. The beverage applejack was produced using this method by first fermenting apple juice into hard apple cider. Then barrels of this cider were left outside during the winter and the connoisseur would occasionally fish out the frozen chunks of water, leaving an ever-concentrated batch of hard alcohol behind. At some point in the 20-25 percent ABV range, the liquor would stop freezing at ambient temperatures and the booze was ready to consume as &quot;Jersey Lightning.&quot; It was also used as currency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moving into the malt-beverage world, brewers in Germany use fractional freezing to make eisbock. These brews are usually just regular bock beers, which clock in at 6 percent ABV, freeze-concentrated to something in the 13 percent ABV range. Frankly, there are probably easier ways to get high-proof beers (make a barleywine, for example) than by starting with a mid-strength one and concentrating it, but there's a market for eisbocks and it's possible to find them in the US as well. A more infamous set of freeze-concentrated beers was made by the Scottish brewery BrewDog in their quest to make &quot;the strongest beer in the world.&quot; The first was Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a beer that started with an ABV in the teens and ended at 32 percent ABV. Then a little brewing war started up between BrewDog and German brewery Schorschbräu to make ever-stronger beers. Schorschbräu made a Schorschbock at 40 percent ABV, BrewDog countered with Sink the Bismarck at 41 percent ABV. Then came another beer at 55 percent ABV (that's 110 proof, my friends). Schorschbräu is current record-holder with Schorschbock 57, at 57 percent ABV.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Article][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/beersci-how-make-strong-beer-stronger" />

Just as a Chihuaua and a Great Dane are both *Canis Lupus*, a Galena Hop and a Goldings Hop are bot *Humulus Lupulus*, separated by vastly different lineages and genetics. New hop varieties are often developed by selective crossbreeding of existing variants, to generate different flavor profiles by adjusting the acidity and oil content of the hop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like different breeds of dogs, different hop varieties are often the products of hundreds of years of genetic development in a particular climate -  the Pacific Northwest, especially the Yakima Valley and Cascade Mountains in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, is known for it's production of very strong, highly acidic hops that impart a very strong bitter flavor - take a sip of a Sierra Nevada IPA and you'll instantly recognize that classic blend of the 'three C's'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By contrast, traditional hops grown in England and on the European continent tend to be more mellow and aromatic - especially the so called 'noble hops' popular in many less bitter tasting German and Czech beers. Still others, like Japans Sorachi Ace, offer a more citrus bite to the beer they're added to. While these differences are not *directly* a product of climate, it's doubtless true that climate has had an impact on the development of variation amongst the various hop lines that have been bred through the centuries -  and especially over the past 50 years or so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put another way: New World vs. Old World Hops is a meaningful distinction, but it has less to do with climate and more to do with the difference in cultivation practices and the specific varietals popular with farmers in various regions. Growing conditions may have some impact, but the specific lineage matters *much, much more*. The fact that those lineages tend to have significant geographic commonalities is as much an accident of history as it is of varying conditions, but it's nonetheless sufficiently meaningful that, in particular referring to hops from the Pacific Northwest evokes a very specific and comprehensible flavor profile in most educated beer drinkers." />

In general I find that aging tends to allow flavors to meld.  If I brew beer and do a brief aging in oak (or add oak chips), the beer usually *requires* aging to achieve balance.  This is most typical with something I sometimes make called ebulon (non-carbonated, fermented malt and elderberries, secondary fermentation in oak for a month, then bottled and aged for several more months).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Extrapolating from my experience here, I would expect a few general rules to apply:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  Beers with disparate sharp contrasts (particularly where fruit are involved) may benefit from aging.  I could imagine things like full-bodied apricot ales aging well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Higher ABV and richer beers are likely to age better than lower ABV and lighter beers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is assuming you hope to see a general &quot;smoothing over&quot; of contrasts in an aged beer.  Some things will usually fade and some others may increase (for non-pasteurized or unfiltered beers, yeast flavors will usually increase)." />

Text="## tl;dr—We don't know (via science, at least).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Letting alone ethanol, which triggers innumerable biochemical pathways in our bodies, hops itself _may_ affect potency and sexual desire, in males at least, but there appears to be few clinical studies supporting this claim directly. Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn't _testosterone_ (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather _its interaction with estrogen_, produced _from_ testosterone through a process known as aromatization.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So it's not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm certainly not qualified to deliver conclusions myself, but I can at least point to some of the important studies from which current (mis)conceptions have derived.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1: [Wu, M. V. et al. Estrogen Masculinizes Neural Pathways and Sex-Specific Behaviors. 2009. [PDF]][1]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Why some claim that hops decreases sex drive...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hops contains phytoestrogens,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; substances that promote estrogenic actions in mammals and structurally are similar to mammalian estrogen 17&amp;beta;-estradiol (E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [...]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Ososki, A. L. and Kennelly, E. J. Phytoestrogens: a Review of the Present State of Research. 2003. [PDF]][2]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Specifically,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a recurring suggestion has been that hops have a powerful estrogenic activity and that beer may also be estrogenic. [...] We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]][3]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it's worth noting that the same paper concludes,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...] despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to &quot;estrogens in beer&quot; are to be expected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 8-Prenylnaringenin alone competed strongly with 17&amp;beta;-estradiol for binding to both the &amp;alpha;- and &amp;beta;-estrogen receptors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Milligan, S. R. et al. The endocrine activities of 8-prenylnargingenin and related hop (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) flavonoids. 2000. [PDF]][4]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(In case one is unfamiliar with how receptors work, receptors &quot;catch&quot; freestanding compounds in a medium such as the bloodstream, thereby reducing their effects. The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself &quot;caught&quot; by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it'd normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## ...but it's not that simple!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can't be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn't be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like &quot;potency,&quot; &quot;sex drive,&quot; and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a very example of the latter, one site [[link](http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx)] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to &quot;prove&quot; that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I'm not saying beer _doesn't_, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, &quot;blocks testosterone,&quot; when in fact _the very paper it cites_ says (in its abstract nonetheless),&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Anti-estrogenic effects of XN [...] were confirmed in vivo in an uterotrophy assay with prepubertal rats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Strathmann, J. et al. Xanthohumol from Hops Prevents Hormone-Dependent Tumourigenesis In Vitro and In Vivo. 2008. [PDF]][5]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On top of all this, ethanol affects so many parts of the brain via so many chemical pathways—what's even the significance of 8-prenylnarigenin or Xanthohumol when stacked against ethanol? Do you know?—I sure don't—and probably no one does—else it'd have been stated by researchers themselves, without the &quot;help&quot; of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## In conclusion,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily _wrong_—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation). What I _am_ saying is that they can't be _right-by-science_, as currently available research seems extremely domain-specific, incomplete in larger perspectives, and therefore not generalizable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://shahlab.ucsf.edu/papers/paper14.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.comilac.com.tr/uploads/pdf/22ComFUGA.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jcem.84.6.5887&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jcem.85.12.7168&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.dkfz.de/en/tox/download/gerh/pdf-files/Proc.-2nd-Humulus-Symposium-2009.pdf" />

The other is the use of Brettanomyces yeast during this same maturation, which are a local wild yeast. Hallertau, Styrian Goldings and French Strisselspalt hops are used. The beer is then matured at 15°C for a minimum of four weeks on site before being distributed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If drunk right after bottling it has a &quot;young&quot; fresh flavor. The beer can be preserved for several years as it re-ferments once bottled. Even 35 year old Orval is still drinkable, if preserved at the right temperature. After about 1 year of preservation the beer flavor changes to a softer, sweeter and more intense experience compared to the young one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two versions of Orval, one is the normal one which can be bought in the stores and then there is also a special *Petite Orval*, which can only be drunk at the Orval abbey and is only produced for the Monks (no mass sale). Its alcohol percentage is a lot lower than the normal Orval. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/bNvYJ.jpg" />

Firstly, there's the added production cost in the bottled or canned product: the widget.  Secondly, I would wager that most breweries want the product to taste similar on draught as in a can or bottle, and it's very uncommon to have nitrogen available in a taproom.  (You can get special taps which &quot;cream&quot; the beer on the way out, but again, for consistency those would have to be installed where-ever you sell your beer.)

Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most (but not all) studies to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency. Alcohol intoxication can decrease sexual arousal, decrease pleasureability and intensity of orgasm, and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since wikipedia show related soruce of that info and most of them are clinical research, we can say that alcohol have a negative effect on men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In many women, alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, although it does lower the physiological signs of arousal. Women have a different response to alcohol intoxication. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption tends to cause increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Since testosterone controls in part the strength of libido in women, this tends to cause an increase in interest in sex. Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women’s bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm. Some women report a greater sexual arousal with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph, which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Different from men, we can say alcohol have more pros beside few cons for women.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Beer and couples&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Men&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beer is probably the least powerful aphrodisiac alcoholic drink. The alcohol percentage in beer is low, meaning that more liquid has to be consumed to raise men's testosterone levels to hit that &quot;comfortable&quot; level. Most beers are very nourishing and filling, and when too many of them are consumed, they can create an unpleasant stomachache. Drinking too much beer will make men go to the washroom more often, as well as create a bloating sensation. The effects of being bloated surely don't entice sexual encounters and won't lead men to seek out sexual opportunities. Yet, some special beers have a local reputation for increasing libido, but even with that, beer is not the best choice for men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Women&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While hops in beer will have a negative impact on men’s hormonal balance, it may actually be positive for women. Hops has aphrodisiac-like qualities for women, as because of the phytoestrogen it contains, which mimic natural estrogen. Low sex drive in women is often cause by low levels of estrogen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consuming beer, especially hop-rich varieties like IPA, could actually help restore hormonal balance and help with libido and also alleviate menopausal symptoms of fatigue, irritability and hot flashes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_and_sex#Alcohol_and_sex_in_men" />

You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can't digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn't work for rice.&#xD;&#xA;2.  helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian &quot;Tape&quot; (rice or cassava &quot;beer&quot; or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).&#xD;&#xA;3.  Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It's very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don't know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine's time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English &quot;beor&quot; means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn't get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don't think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now as for lager, these are far more recent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally as a note, until maybe a hundred years ago, before modern capping and beer cans, most beer would have been sold uncarbonated, but speciality beers were carbonated much like champagne is today.  My own home brewing experiments (I even brew as a history nut) with non-carbonated beers suggest that they are of an altogether different character than carbonated ones (owing to the carbonic acid in carbonated drinks).  The flavors are lighter, sweeter, brighter, and more distinct, and entirely different than &quot;flat&quot; beer.  This is because dissolved carbon dioxide imparts extra acidity to beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT**:  It also occurs to me that controlled fermentation is one of the most common ways of preserving foods in the pre-industrial ages.  This includes lactic fermentation (that gives us shelf-stable cheese, salami, sauerkraut, etc), but also alcoholic fermentation must be included there too.  There's no reason to think that the first fermented grains were fermented by accident." />

Some kegs have a pressure relief valve that can be pulled to reduce pressure. But do it in small bursts, and try the beer after each until you see that the beer comes out not to quickly.&#xD;&#xA; 2. increase the resistance outside the keg by using a longer beer line and/or placing the keg somewhere low and serving the beer higher. (e.g. keg at ground level and stand up to serve the beer.)&#xD;&#xA; 3. dispense a large amount beer to a large jug - removing beer from the keg will reduce the pressure in the keg, and keeping it in a jug gives time for the head on the beer to settle down.

They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.  I think this also helps explain why richer beers are more often served warm than lighter beers." />

The smoky bacon flavor comes both from the actual inclusion of bacon and from the smoked malt: *Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt, Weyermann Beechwood Smoked Malt, House-smoked Hickory Malt*.  As discussed in http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/53/does-chocolate-stout-contain-real-chocolate/65#65, certain flavors can be achieved through the malting process rather than through additional ingredients.  Similarly maple is fermentable and could be added directly to boost alcohol content and impart a more subtle maple flavor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, this beer does contain actual bacon and &quot;maple flavor&quot;.  To get a look at and when and how the flavors are added, we can look at [this clone recipe](http://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/inspired-by-rogue-voodoo-doughnut-maple-bacon-ale). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Name              Amount     Time        Use&#xD;&#xA;    Fenugreek         0.25 oz    5.0 min     Boil&#xD;&#xA;    Maple Extract     1.0 oz     6.0 days    Primary&#xD;&#xA;    Bacon, cooked     4.0 oz     0.0 days    Bottle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, fenugreek is added during the boil phase, while creating the wort.  The boiling helps extract the flavor from the herb.  Maple extract gets added later during fermentation.  Maple extract or syrup could be used, but syrup is more expensive and fermentable so a stronger maple flavor is being achieved with extract.  The official ingredient list calls for &quot;Pure Maple Flavoring&quot; so I assume the same is being done there.  Lastly the bacon is being added at the end.  This is to add direct flavoring to the beer without interfering in the fermentation process." />

Heavy, high starch beers, have long been used as a food source for fasting monks, sort of a liquid bread.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  Beer is commonly used for cooking certain things because the alcohol (as with wine) helps bring out certain flavors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally I want to mention something I use it for.  This works for me because of very specific reasons and **I am not recommending that anyone else try it.**  However, I get asthma frequently following upper respiratory illnesses (I have since I was a teenager).  I have a couple of alternative medical strategies for dealing with this depending on what is available.  Note, if you have asthma, don't take medical advice from me: asthma can be life threatening.  Work with a doctor.   However, among other things, I find that drinking a number of drinks of beer or wine for two nights in a row will cause the asthma to clear up until I get sick again.  This naturally works best when I am not otherwise consuming alcohol, but it allows me to be mostly medication free regarding my asthma (doing this two to three times a year).  Again this has a bunch of risks, so I am mentioning it just for informational purposes.  In general anything medical deserves a great deal of respect because what can cure can kill.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also some kinds of traditional beer have very specific health benefits.  In Indonesia, &quot;tape hitam&quot; (black rice beer, consumed with the lees as a sort of soup) is generally understood to reduce blood cholesterol.

It's similar in&#xD;&#xA;   principle to the fluted champagne glass, but having larger rim,&#xD;&#xA;   affords larger sips.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The traditional mug is a robust glass, primarly aimed at &quot;chinking&quot;&#xD;&#xA;   glasses together and allowing large swallows of beer. &#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The challace/goblet can be beautiful pieces of work, designed to&#xD;&#xA;   showcase the beer, and also promote and maintain a large head. &#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The tulip glass captures volatiles (in the narrow part of the glass)&#xD;&#xA;   while the large opening at the top supports a large head.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The Sniffer, typically used for cognac/brandy, but also for very&#xD;&#xA;   strong ales, has a large base that curves up to a small opening to&#xD;&#xA;   capture the aromatics, and to allow for swirling to encourage more&#xD;&#xA;   aromatics to be released.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The Stange, a long tall glass, amplifies the malt and hop&#xD;&#xA;   characteristics by concentrating them in a smaller area, while also&#xD;&#xA;   providing a simple elegant presentation of the beer. Often used with&#xD;&#xA;   delicate beers.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The Weizen glass is similar to the pilsner glass, but larger&#xD;&#xA;   (typically 0.5l minimum) with plenty of room for the large head&#xD;&#xA;   typical of a wheat beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more details and images, see http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/glassware/" />

In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer I think to the question as stated has to be &quot;no&quot; insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while &quot;ealu&quot; (-&gt; ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, &quot;beor&quot; (-&gt; beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen (&quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot;) suggests that &quot;beor&quot; must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources on history:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

The beer may be perfectly drinkable, but be marked down because it doesn't fit with the style. For example, a hefeweizen that is dark would be lose points for appearance since they are light-colored beers by style.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Judging sheets often have a list of flavor descriptors. Some flavors are bad for any beer, such as rubber, astringent, soapy, while others may or may not be considered faults depending upon style. For example, fruitiness in an English Ale is much desired, but not in a Pilsner, similarly low levels of diacetyl in a Stout is acceptable, but not in a Hefeweizen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [BJCP Scoresheet][1] provides a working example of the notes a beer judge&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.bjcp.org/docs/SCP_BeerScoreSheet.pdf" />

In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer I think to the question as stated has to be &quot;no&quot; insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while &quot;ealu&quot; (-&gt; ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, &quot;beor&quot; (-&gt; beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen (&quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot;) suggests that &quot;beor&quot; must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources on history:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  Hagen, Ann.  &quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Pollington, Stephen.  &quot;Leechcraft&quot; (for an edition of Bald's Leechbook with facing page translation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Example 2:  Medieval Iceland&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (godhi, bondi, and thrall) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a godhi (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a godhord (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A bondi (free juryman) owned land.  And a thrall was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill's Saga, Njall's Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from &quot;continental&quot; Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki's Saga.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It's probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There's a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further reading:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* the various sagas referenced above.&#xD;&#xA;* The Poetic Edda (I usually recommend the Hollander translation if you are going to work in translation because he tends to be transparent about which emendations he is using).&#xD;&#xA;* Byock, Jesse:  Viking-Age Iceland&#xD;&#xA;* Byock, Jesse:  Medieval Iceland&#xD;&#xA;* Roesdahl, Else: The Vikings&#xD;&#xA;* Pollington, Stephen: Leechcraft (for some archaeological discussions of Scandinavian forts and brewing)." />

By contrasting beers side-by-side, we build an _internal_, as-of-yet-wordless &quot;vocabulary&quot; of tastes, _e.g_ &quot;This beer has more of... _that thing_, whatever it's called, than this one,&quot; and _then_ we learn terminology (and ingredients and processes) as a means of filling those voids in words for senses we've experienced. Otherwise, we're storing abstract definitions, which we don't retain very well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/9elD1.png" />

What you want is a good *experience*, and taste is only a part (albeit a major part) of that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having different glasses for different types of beers can affect your drinking experience in a number of different ways. First off, having an unusual or unique glass can often be very fun, because it's probably not something you're used to. The first time I ever drank beer from a litre mug was a very fun experience for me, and not because it made the beer taste differently. Secondly, I find that different types of glasses encourage me to enjoy beer in different ways. I find that glasses with stems, which are often used for stronger beers, encourage me to drink the beer more slowly and savour it a bit more than a glass without a stem. I think these effects on experience are one of the big reasons for the wide variations in beer glassware. As a beer manufacturer, if I could make a unique glass that will better help people remember my beer, I would consider that a worthwhile investment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not trying to say that the effects of glassware on taste don't exist or are unimportant; I think they are important.

Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn't _testosterone_ (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather _its interaction with estrogen_, produced _from_ testosterone through a process known as aromatization.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So it's not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm certainly not qualified to deliver conclusions myself, but I can at least point to some of the important studies from which current (mis)conceptions have derived.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1: [Wu, M.

[...] We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]][3]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it's worth noting that the same paper concludes,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...] despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to &quot;estrogens in beer&quot; are to be expected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 8-Prenylnaringenin alone competed strongly with 17&amp;beta;-estradiol for binding to both the &amp;alpha;- and &amp;beta;-estrogen receptors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Milligan, S. R. et al. The endocrine activities of 8-prenylnargingenin and related hop (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) flavonoids. 2000.

The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself &quot;caught&quot; by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it'd normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## ...but it's not that simple!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can't be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn't be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like &quot;potency,&quot; &quot;sex drive,&quot; and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a very example of the latter, one site [[link](http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx)] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to &quot;prove&quot; that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I'm not saying beer _doesn't_, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, &quot;blocks testosterone,&quot; when in fact _the very paper it cites_ says (in its abstract nonetheless),&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Anti-estrogenic effects of XN [...] were confirmed in vivo in an uterotrophy assay with prepubertal rats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Strathmann, J. et al.

Do you know?—I sure don't—and probably no one does—else it'd have been stated by researchers themselves, without the &quot;help&quot; of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## In conclusion,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily _wrong_—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation).

Since the keg is kept at room temperature, if the beer is unpasteurized the flavor will evolve at a faster rate than refrigerated beer would.  This isn't a change due to the quick cooling, per se, but it is a possibly major difference.&#xD;&#xA; 2. As mentioned by @acheong, the CO2 solubility of beer is significantly lower at room temperature, so keeping the beer properly carbonated becomes a more difficult task.  Specifically, you have to keep the pressure much higher, making the serving pressure higher, which makes the complex calculus of draft line measurements that much harder.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Chill haze could be an issue.  If the brewer didn't take steps to prevent it, there'll be haze-inducing proteins in suspension.  If the beer is stored cool, these will quickly fall out, but if it's kept warm and only cooled at the time it's served, they'll end up in your glass." />

Could be fun, though.  :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most commercial beer is *force-carbonated*.  That is to say, the beer is produced and ready to drink (minus the fizz) before they put it in the bottle and mechanically carbonate the beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beer that is *bottle-conditioned* or *bottle-fermented*, however, is put into a bottle with some extra sugar.  The beer is intentionally left with a little of the yeast from the fermentation process, and is sealed with the sugar.  The yeast then does it's normal thing: it eats the sugar and excretes alcohol plus carbon-dioxide.  Since the bottle is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, so it goes into dissolution in the beer, giving you that fizz.  Most bottled homebrew will be like this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, if you have a beer that is both flat and was bottle-conditioned (and therefore still has some yeast in it), you might be able to bottle-ferment it again:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Add a very small amount of sugar to the bottle.  Table sugar works, although corn sugar (which you can find from a brew store) is ideal.  It'll be really hard to get the right amount (about 0.083 oz), so I recommend pre-measured tablets of the stuff: http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/munton-s-carb-tabs.html&#xD;&#xA;2. Seal the bottle somehow.  If you have a [bottle-capper](http://www.amazon.com/Bottle-Capper-Red-Baron-Homebrew/dp/B000Q6ARMY) and some caps, that'd be ideal.  Otherwise, you might be able to get by with a soda bottle and cap.

Wait a week, maybe a couple to be sure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're lucky, there's enough viable yeast in the bottle to start acting again (now that it has new sugar to eat), which will create more CO2 and recarbonate the bottle." />

The original gravity of the beer (gravity measure the amount of sugar in the wort), the type and strain of yeast used, and alcohol content of the finished beer.  Other factors such as any adjuncts used in the beer can affect this as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, a low gravity, low alcohol ale using an efficient yeast strain can be ready to drink in as little as 10 days.  However a heavy lager beer can take 2-3 months to complete and some Belgian yeast strains can take several weeks to complete fermentation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some beers go through additional conditioning post-fermentation before they are at their prime to drink.  This conditioning may include simple bottle conditioning or barrel-aging to impart different flavors.  There are some barrel-ages stout beers that have taken 18+ months to complete the process before the brewer feels they are ready to serve." />

According to it, the suggested pairing for an IPA is&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Strong, spicy food (classic with curry!); bold, sweet desserts like carrot cake&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and for a Double/Imperial IPA is&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Smoked beef brisket, grilled lamb; Southern chicken-fried steak.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found a great little [summary by Michael Agnew (2012)](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/03/what-to-eat-with-ipa-india-pale-ale-food-pairings.html) that explains some of the rationale behind these pairings (emphasis mine hereon):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When pairing IPA with food you have three basic flavor hooks at your disposal; bitterness, hop flavor (spicy, grassy, herbal, earthy, and citrus), and caramel. Hop flavors have a great affinity for spices and light fruits. Bitterness has a cooling affect. Paired with **spicy dishes**, IPA will fan the flames at first, but douse them in the end. Bitterness also amplifies **salty and umami flavors**. The caramel flavors in the beer will latch onto the sweeter side of a dish, tying into things like **caramelized onion** or the crispy skins of roast poultry. And the hop acids and carbonation make IPAs **great palate cleansers** to take on even the fattiest deep-fried delights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Samuel Adams has a &quot;Pair with Sam&quot; tool, and looking at its [suggested pairings for their Whitewater IPA](http://www.samueladams.com/food-and-craft-beer/pair-with-sam?beer-name=whitewater-ipa&amp;beerid=7abae512-5798-4f59-bd3e-98698adcd1bf) (hoppier than their Latitude 48 IPA), **pork appears to be the meat of choice: pulled pork, barbeque ribs, chorizo, roasted pork tenderloin, and sweet sausage**; and the rest of its suggestions align with the salty-and-spicy pattern we've  seen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We seem to have found strong consensus already, but just one more to make sure. In [Blue Point Brewing Company's words](http://bluepointbrewing.com/bpbc/food-pairings/guide-to-pairing/), its IPA pairings are meant to complement&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intensely flavorful, highly spiced dishes, such as curry, and bold, sweet desserts like flourless chocolate cake and crème brulée&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rich, aromatic, spicy and smoked foods such as chili, BBQ ribs, grilled chicken, and beef.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, I think they stole those words from Wegmans' [Guide to Beer and Food Pairing](http://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=667885&amp;storeId=10052)." />

It is believed that these farmhouse beers would have been of a lower abv than modern saisons - probably initially around 3 to 3.5% abv on average, rising in the early 20th century to between 4.5 and 6.5% abv.

I've got a big dog (Neapolitan Mastiff) though, so my package carriers usually just sign for me and run for the hills when they have the displeasure of delivering something to my house haha. So I'm not sure if they'd bother checking my ID if I ever bought beer online. I'm perfectly legal drinking age though, so it doesn't matter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With that said, you'd probably be best off looking through your local laws and maybe start a petition to have it legalized. I don't think its in the best interests of this community to be discussing loopholes in the law (despite how much I hate the government). I say start a petition, maybe it'll become a proposition and be placed on the ballot come election day. The only other option would be to have it shipped to another address in a border state if you live near the border. No online beer distributor is going to violate the law or tamper with it to make a buck, there's too much liability; they could lose their license and be put out of business." />

The compression and expansion causes agitation which foams up the beer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tell me more...&#xD;&#xA;---------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The layman's summary from [Scientists discover why beer bottles overflow after a sudden impact][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A lot happens in the short period of time between tap and torrent. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; moment some jerk clocks your bottle's mouth, a compression wave&#xD;&#xA;&gt; travels down through the glass. When the wave hits bottom, it's&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reflected as an expansion wave that travels through the beer. These&#xD;&#xA;&gt; waves keep bouncing back and forth, with the compression waves&#xD;&#xA;&gt; breaking up the CO2 bubbles in your beer into thousands of incredibly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; tiny microbubbles, and the expansion waves causing those microbubbles&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to violently expand into skyrocketing plumes.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The result? Millions and millions of expanding CO2 bubbles turn your&#xD;&#xA;&gt; beer into foam shooting out of your bottle. With any luck, it spills&#xD;&#xA;&gt; all over your jerk friend's pants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The abstract from the [published article][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A sudden vertical impact on the mouth of a beer bottle generates a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; compression wave that propagates through the glass towards the bottom.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When this wave reaches the base of the bottle, it is transmitted to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the liquid as an expansion wave that travels to free surface, where it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bounces back as a compression wave. This train of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; expansion-compression waves drives the forced cavitation of existing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; air pockets, leading to their violent collapse. A cloud of very small&#xD;&#xA;&gt; daughter bubbles are generated upon these collapses, that expand much&#xD;&#xA;&gt; faster than their mothers due to their smaller size. These rapidly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; growing bubble clusters effectively act as buoyancy sources, what&#xD;&#xA;&gt; leads to the formation of bubble-laden plumes whose void fraction&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increases quickly by several orders of magnitude, eventually turning&#xD;&#xA;&gt; most of the liquid into foam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://gizmodo.com/the-fascinating-science-behind-why-a-tapped-beer-foams-1451022759/1451360561/@jesusdiaz&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3747" />

In the 18th century, most beers were dark due to being produced with barley malt that was kilned or roasted over wood fires. But from England emerged a new technique using [pale malts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_ingredients#Pale_malt), cured in [coke-fuelled kilns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)). This applied to both ales and lagers, resulting in beers that were bronze, copper or gold—and while you wouldn't look at such colors today and consider them notably &quot;pale,&quot; they certainly were pale in contrast to beers back then. In the turn of the 19th century and beyond, the style spread from England to the rest of Europe—&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When a new brewery was built in Pilsen in Bohemia in 1842, a coke-fired kiln was imported from England.

The main thing for the beer is to keep the temperature steady and relatively low (around 50F) and keep light out.  Even with brown bottles there's still some UV penetration, which you want none of.  So keep it dark when you're not in there and try to avoid florescent lighting when you're there.  Keeping it organized also helps you minimize your time in there, which keeps light and temperature steady.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't worry too much about the air flow as long as it's not completely stagnant and all the areas of the room are getting some air of the right temperature.

Winemakers were allowed to continue producing various grape products like grape juice, and even sold home wine kits with explicit instructions on how to avoid making wine from them.  Very tongue-in-cheek.  A lot of liquor distillers managed to survive somewhat on their liquors being considered &quot;medicinal&quot;.  Beer, however, basically got demolished.  Especially considering their suffering during World War 1, which had just ended when prohibition began.  Any businesses that survived prohibition that used to be breweries either became producers of other products like ice cream or made barely alcoholic barley-based beverages.  Brewing in the US was at a huge disadvantage coming out of prohibition, and the few surviving large companies managed to successfully lobby to have the new distribution laws written to benefit them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, as I mentioned wine and liquor sort of continued to be produced during Prohibition.  This led to their presence in the speakeasies, and their inclusion in the invention of many new cocktails.  People being used to them over the past few years, and the allure of being what was drank in speakeasies, acted as built in marketing.  Which beer lacked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, beer was much less transportable than wine or liquor, especially liquor.  While localized wineries managed to survive, most people's local brewery had folded.  Liquor and wine became go-to drinks, and the only beer being promoted was from a few larger companies that needed to ramp up to reach everyone.  They were basically able to write their own ticket.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We're sort of in the opposite place now where consumer demand is for beer instead of liquor and wine, and the demand is for beer that's coming from smaller and more regional breweries, which I imagine is how wine was back in the day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not an historian, some of this is inference from known fact rather than referenced fact, but I think it makes sense and hopefully it helps you." />

For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Beer has much higher shipping costs per dollar worth of product, so shipping rules might need to be different.&#xD;&#xA;- Breweries have a need to keep their product cold at the point of sale, so it might make sense to have them sold in stores that already have coolers (like gas stations), whereas liquor companies wouldn't push as hard for that availability.&#xD;&#xA;- Liquor has no equivalent of the brewpub, so they don't really care much about sales at their production facility.&#xD;&#xA;- Beer has less consumer utility per unit of volume than liquor (ie, you need more of it to have the same amount of fun), so people generally need it closer to their houses.

E. Mechanism of Dehydration Following Alcohol Ingestion. 1963. \[Abstract (HTML)\]][1]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far back as the 1930s, researchers were trying to understand whether alcohol—the substance itself—is a diuretic, or indirectly induces chemicals which are diuretic (or which inhibit antidiuretics) or triggers cortical functions that cause diuresis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [Most] writers either state categorically or imply that alcohol per se has no diuretic action. In 1932, however, from a comparison of the diuretic effects of a given volume of water, with and without alcohol, [...] Murray concluded that alcohol itself was exerting a diuretic action. [...] The diuretic action of alcohol has now been demonstrated on five other subjects, and its mode of action investigated [...]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Eggleton, M. G. The Diuretic Action of Alcohol in Man. 1941. \[Full Paper (PDF)\]][2]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first paper (1963) actually confirmed that **alcohol—yes, ethanol itself—inhibits antidiuretic hormones, causing diuresis, causing dehydration.** (Caffeine does this too, by the way.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, yeah. That's how that happens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unrelated, but I found this interesting in the second paper...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It [the diuresis] is initiated by the _increase_ in blood-alcohol concentration and fails to be maintained if this concentration is kept steady, even at high levels [...] The diuretic response to alcohol differs markedly in one respect from that of the cerebral cortex. The latter is most affected by the _rate_ of increase in blood-alcohol concentration: the greater this rate of increase, the greater the disturbance of function at any absolute concentration. The diuretic response, on the other hand, is dependent mainly on the _duration_ of increasing blood-alcohol concentration and not on the rate of increase (Tables 6, 7). The naturally slow absorber, therefore, tends to give a larger diuretic response than the rapid absorber.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The slower you get drunk, the more dehydrated you'll be!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=568848&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://jp.physoc.org/content/101/2/172.full.pdf" />

I think you have to look at these laws as an intersection of the practical and the cultural.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at two different distinctions you make.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Home Production**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the US, you can usually make your own beer, mead, or wine, but cannot make hard liquor without a license from BATF, state licenses, tax payments, etc.  Exact laws of course vary state by state, but the US tax code contains exemptions for home brewers and wine makers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Part of the reason here is historical.  Liquor is a major tax source, and black market liquor hasn't always been very safe.  We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don't believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component." />

When measured with a hydrometer, it measures the density relative to water. E.g. 1.010 is 1% heavier than water. The units here are [degrees Plato][1] (&amp;deg;P), which describe the amount of dissolved sugars. Here, 15 means 15% dissolved sugar. This means the beer (or more correctly, the [wort][2]) contained 15% sugar before fermentation started.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;RDF - The real degree of fermentation. This is in contrast to the Apparent Degree of Fermentation, which is (OG-FG)/OG. When the final gravity is measured using hydrometer, the alcohol in the beer, being less dense than water ([SG. 0.789][3]) causes the gravity to appear lower, so it looks as though the yeast has fermented more sugar than it actually has. The Real degree of Fermentation takes the alcohol into account and computes the actual amount of sugars fermented. This tells you the how much of the original sugar was fermented (as a percentage). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what does this mean in practice?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Winter Bock - 15 OG, 62.5 RDF - light, tasty, ever so slightly bitter&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This has an average RDF for a beer that size, so it will be somewhat malty, but not cloying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hazelnut Dark - 15 OG, 60.4 RDF - nice bitter red with slightly sweet aftertaste&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This has more dissolved sugars in it compared to the Bock, so you'd expect it to be a thicker mouthfeel and slightly more sweet, although you may not taste the sweetness if it's offset by roasted malts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Chocolate Stout - 14.8 OG, 66.8 RDF - very sweet with hints of chocolate and malt&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being the driest of all the beers, yet the taste description is given as very sweet. This shows that knowing the residual sugars doesn't tell you the sweetness, simply because there are different kinds of residual sugar. For example, dextrins create body, but have relatively little taste, so would taste not as sweet as a beer containing a lot of residual maltose or glucose. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Strength&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol" />

The reason has nothing to do with alcohol content or getting drunk (some beers like Belgian tripels, imperial stouts, or barley wines can easily clock in at a higher ABV than wines). It's got more to do with the human tongue itself and how taste buds are organized on the tongue. Essentially, beer is a much more complex drink; beer tasters use all of their taste buds while wine drinkers may only use a select few. So when you drink beer, you're not going to be overwhelming any set of taste buds unevenly while you run that risk when drinking wine.  Generally when drinking wine, you're only using your sweet and sour sets of taste buds. For instance, I don't know about you, but I've never really had a bitter wine. I've had sweet or sour wines, but never bitter or salty wines. On the other hand, I've had all of that with beer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you look at the diagram of the tongue below, you'll notice that the bitter taste bud receptors are on the back of the tongue.

I only have the theory that due to the feeling of the container you drink from, your taste is altered (just like food with the same flavour/taste somehow tastes differently, with a different texture). Additionally I think the amount of beer that flows into your mouth is differently, as well as maybe the turbulence, causing a different amount of carbon dioxide (or nitrogen, depending on your beer culture) to leave the beer before you can actually taste and swallow (which again changes the texture)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

It is benefical if a beer is 8-10 percent or stronger, since an elevated alcohol profile will typically become smoother, mellower and more agreeable. That does not mean lower alcohol percentage beers can not be aged, but higer percentage beers are more suitable most of the time. &#xD;&#xA; 2. *Dark Malt:* like Palo Santo and World Wide Stout. Darker, maltier beer is better because the sweet, residual sugars tend to soften over time. Even lower-alcohol beers with a malt-heavy profile will age better. &#xD;&#xA; 3. *Wild Beers:* living organisms change the beer as it ages in the bottle. Orval Trappist Ale is a classic example. The Belgian pale ale receives a dose of Brettanomyces yeast as it goes in the bottle. The yeast can live in the bottle for years, slowly consuming sugars and protecting the beer’s existing flavors by consuming oxygen. Over time it goes from being bright and hoppy to bready, earthy and spicy. But sometimes they are unstable, because the yeast rapidly works through a beer and alters its character.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*What not to age:* IPA do not improve with age. Hoppy beers are not for aging." />

This is because, unlike the vast majority of wine, beer is carbonated (albeit to varying degrees). When you swallow beer, some of the carbonation escapes the liquid as gas, and actually rises up from your throat into your nose (or, at least, into your nasal passages), carrying with it some of the flavor molecules of the beer. Thus your sense of smell combines with your sense of taste to produce an overall sense of flavor in a manner that is different from what occurs when you drink (uncarbonated) wine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you spit out your beer, you're ruining the experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(This explanation is based on one that I heard years ago from a brewmaster at Anheuser-Busch. I can't remember his exact words, but you get the gist.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a side note, regarding the important relationship between taste and smell, I'm sure you will see tasters at both beer tastings and especially wine tastings swirl their drink a bit to smell it from the glass before tasting it.

That'll be the most accurate price estimate, although you're not likely to find *really* rare stuff on there because of the small audience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, there are a number of books on the subject, of which breweriana helpfully lists [a few](http://www.breweriana.com/beer-can-appraisal/books-on-beer-cans.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, the [BCCA](http://www.bcca.com/) is the largest organization around beer can collecting, and have a lot of resource son the subject.  You can use their site to find a local chapter and ask someone about your specific collection in person.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To expand on this a little, here is a really quick guide:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If it's from the mid 70s or so on, it's probably not that valuable.  Exceptions sometimes include aluminum cans, cans with [punch tops](http://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/UncleDearest/Vintage_Miller_High_Life_1956_Flat_Top_Beer_Can.jpg), and cans with [cone tops](http://www.beercansrus.com/mcart/images/reischcone1.jpg).&#xD;&#xA;- If it's in poor condition, it's probably not worth much unless it's quite rare.  Unless it's better than &quot;grade 2&quot; (defined as &quot;Has a clean label, but there may be rust or other blemishes near the seam, the lid, or the bottom. Colors may be irregular&quot;), it's probably not valuable.&#xD;&#xA;- American OIs (opening instructions, named after the instructions that came with them on how to open them) can be worth $35 to $1000.  Most others before the 70s will have a chance of being between $10 and $500, depending on their rarity." />

But why is that so? I only have the theory that due to the feeling of the container you drink from, your taste is altered (just like food with the same flavour/taste somehow tastes different, with a different texture). Additionally I think the amount of beer that flows into your mouth is different, as well as maybe the turbulence, causing a different amount of carbon dioxide (or nitrogen, depending on your beer culture) to leave the beer before you can actually taste and swallow (which again changes the texture)." />

Even though there is less carbonation than in root beer (and I presume similarly less foam, though still a significant quantity) the irregular surface of the ice cream offers a massively larger number of nucleation sites than the smooth glass of your favorite beer vessel.

One that the alcohol content will &quot;sneak&quot; up on you because it isn't very obvious in the taste.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quoting from the [Beer Judge Criteria][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  Aroma: Complex with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fruity esters and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana&#xD;&#xA;&gt; character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop&#xD;&#xA;&gt; character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; light. No diacetyl.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No&#xD;&#xA;&gt; diacetyl.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high&#xD;&#xA;&gt; carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but&#xD;&#xA;&gt; little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but&#xD;&#xA;&gt; slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded&#xD;&#xA;&gt; malt flavor but should not be sweet.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30&#xD;&#xA;&gt; IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in the bottle”).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; History: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Westmalle.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast&#xD;&#xA;&gt; strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if&#xD;&#xA;&gt; used, should not be recognizable as such.

European beer is not served warm.  Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**To answer your question:**  Mulled beer **is** heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn't *need* to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.

Contrary to the previous answer, I find they taste less bitter than typical beers, although perhaps it may be because the bitterness is masked by the other flavors perhaps?  It may depend, though; Chimay yellow label has a note of bitterness that I don't find in, say, a Westmalle.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Part of it depends on what you're used to.

The name was used to indicate the strength of the Westmalle beers. Originally there was the Enkel, Dubbel and Tripel. It is said that they represent the holy trinity. Later quadruppels were added. Both Dubbel and Tripel as name were first used by the Trappist brewery of Westmalle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Westmalle produced the first dark beer in 1856 named &quot;Dubbel&quot; (the recipe was changed in 1926). Dubbels are dark in color, and tend to have malt flavors dominating over hops. Whereas the Quadrupels have more of a fruit presence, the Dubbels tend to be a bit spicier with strong caramel flavors. They tend to have an ABV of 6.5-9.0%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Chimay Red&#xD;&#xA; - La Trappe Dubbel&#xD;&#xA; - Ommegang&#xD;&#xA; - Westvleteren 8 &#xD;&#xA; - Rochefort 6&#xD;&#xA; - Westmalle Dubbel&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tripels are lighter color, often blonde. They are generally a lot fruitier and lighter in flavor. The name Tripel originally was first used in 1956 by the Westmalle brewery to name their strongest beer (originally produced in 1930 and named Superbier, it was renamed to Tripel). The ABV is a lot higher than the double,  8.0-12.0%. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Tripel Karmeliet&#xD;&#xA; - Westmalle Tripel&#xD;&#xA; - St. Bernardus Tripel&#xD;&#xA; - Leuvense Tripel&#xD;&#xA; - Chimay Cinq Cents Tripel " />

Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and evidence from these cultures (ancient China, Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big clay pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like [Dogfish Head's ancient ales][1]), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the other answers indicate, there are no &quot;modern styles&quot; (e.g. [styles you'd find in the BJCP style guide][2]), that have [no carbonation][3], but several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. [Sahti][4] also has very little carbonation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there's some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like [chicha][5] in Latin America ([Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer][6]) and [umqombothi][7] in South Africa.

Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and [evidence][1] from these cultures ([ancient China][2], Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big stone and earthenware pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like [Dogfish Head's ancient ales][3]), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the other answers indicate, there are no &quot;modern styles&quot; (e.g. [styles you'd find in the BJCP style guide][4]), that have [no carbonation][5], but several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. [Sahti][6] also has very little carbonation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there's some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like [chicha][7] in Latin America ([Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer][8]) and [umqombothi][9] in South Africa. There are other names for similar beers in other regions.

Guinness has actually replaced the widget in some of their &quot;draught&quot; packages as well, I believe the draught bottles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But for a beer like Miller Genuine Draft, or the other Japanese beers you're mentioning, it just means the beer is unpasteurized which gives it a flavor more like what you get from a fresh, unpasteurized keg rather than a pasteurized and/or filtered bottled beer.

But there are no additional chemical reactions caused by temperature changes, so warming to room temperature and re-chilling multiple times is not going to have any added effects on the beer. Assuming you are drinking it within a few weeks, you won't notice the difference with bottled or canned beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this myth took hold from left-over kegs after parties: A half-empty keg that was dispensed by pumping air into it will start to oxidize much more quickly since oxygen is being added to it. When it warms the oxidation speeds up and it tastes stale within a day or two. Keeping it cold slows that down a bit, but even cold it won't last very long. A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all of this, I am referring to room temperature. Beer left in a car in the sun for hours will start to stale much more quickly, even if bottles are protected from the sunlight. You won't get the skunky flavor caused by the light, but it will taste stale." />

To elaborate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there is still the complication that IBUs do not really correlate with perceived bitterness because other aspects of beer affect the perception of bitterness. For example, two beers containing 25 IBUs will be perceived very different with respect to bitterness if one beer had an O.G. of 10 °Plato and finished at 1.5 °Plato and the other beer had an O.G. of 12.5 °Plato and finished at 2.5 °Plato. Begin varying the malt bill by adding crystal malt, for example, and changing the content of various water salts and things become even muddier. This is the reason that measures like the IBU are extremely useful when used within a population of similar beers, but not so handy when looking at very different populations.&#xD;&#xA;- http://byo.com/light-ale/item/2084-measuring-ibus-mr-wizard" />

Glass-making in England was then in its infancy; the first glass-making factory had only recently been established. Many of the first yard glasses have not survived due to their brittle nature, until George Ravenscroft (1674) introduced a new glass process known as the flint glass.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The yard of ale was made and used not for normal drinking purposes, but for feast and manly displays of prowess. During Anglo-Saxon times through the Middle Ages, the English nation has always engaged in the traditions of heavy drinking. As put in Young’s quote “England’s Bane” written in 1617, “He is a man of no fashion that can not drink by the dozen, by the yard, so by measure we drink out of measure.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Legend suggests that the yard was also used in old England to serve the driver of a coach. Upon arriving at their destination and relieving its passengers, the coachman would stay and the length of the yard glass would allow him some refreshment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the same information is repeated in [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_of_ale).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm certain that most of the history of using this style of vessel comes from fellow drinkers trying to show each other up at parties, but aside from the sheer volume (and perhaps limitations of glass-making artisans), how did this length and volume of the glass first come about?  Is there more definitive evidence for the year of birth of the yard, besides the milestone in their history of the introduction of flint glass? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm also curious about whether the volume of the glass was satisfying to stagecoach drivers because of their need to wait long periods for their passenger, or whether it was just easier to hand them a tall glass as they remained in the seat.

It doesn’t contain oysters, just called Oyster Stout as this style of ale is a great complement to shell fish dishes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.classicales.co.uk/Products/Marstons_Oyster_Stout/48" />

In fact, there is no evidence that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; yard of ale was ever used to refresh coach drivers at all (and if it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; had been, it certainly wouldn’t have been handed up to the driver&#xD;&#xA;&gt; through an inn window, which would be an excellent way to either spill&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the ale or smash the glass). Instead, I think, it seems clear that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; yard of ale was (1) produced as something of a show-off, for the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; glassmaker and the owner, and (2) primarily or almost solely supplied&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and bought as a “forfeit glass”, for use in drinking games and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contests of skill, just as it is today.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called [Medovukha][1], which is made with honey and yeast. It's apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you've got Russian honey cakes and [other food based items][2]. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it's antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I'd be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn't use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I've used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/medovukha/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://russian.lingualift.com/blog/honey-tradition-russia/" />

To summarize, lambics are exposed to wild yeast (rather than the usual cultivated yeasts) and tend to have a dry, tart taste.  These are not heavy-bodied beers, nor are they bitter.  (Hops are used for their preservative effect, but old, dry hops are used to minimize the flavor impact.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Frequently, lambics (like the one you had) have fruit added later in fermentation.  Common fruits for this include raspberry, peach, and cherry, and I've also encountered apple.  The sweetness you're tasting probably comes from the fruit (and some of these varieties taste sweeter to me than others).  If you'd like to try a lambic that doesn't have the fruit, which is likely to be less sweet, look for &quot;gueuze&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I don't know of any drinking culture that really does encourage the *warm* serving of beer in any normal understanding of the word. 'Warm' really refers to cellar temperature rather than refrigerator or just-above-zero temperature. A similar temperature to that you'd expect in red wine would be appropriate for the 'warm' beers.

With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called [Medovukha][1], which is made with honey and yeast. It's apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you've got Russian honey cakes and [other food based items][2]. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it's antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I'd be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn't use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I've used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps some substantiating points:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Baltika Medovoe Light seems to be a popular &quot;first Russian beer&quot; to try. It's a pale lager with natural honey added.&#xD;&#xA; - Indeed honey does seem to have played a central role in Russian culture.&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Like the Assumption, the three &quot;Saviors&quot; (_Spas_), August 1, 6, and 16, were associated with the fruits of the earth. The first was called the &quot;Honey&quot; (_medovyi_) or &quot;Wet Savior&quot; (_mokryi Spas_), signifying either the gathering of honey or the religious procession and blessing of the waters traditional for this day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;sup&gt;[Ivanits, L. &quot;Russian Folk Belief.&quot; [http://books.google.com]](http://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC).&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; According to Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevskii (1841–1911), we must learn about the Russian forest, river and steppe in order to understand the Russian people. [...] &quot;The forest provided the Russian with oak and pine to build his house, it warmed him with aspen and birch, it lit his hut with birchwood splinters, it shod him in birch bast sandals, it gave him plates and dishes, clothed him in hides and furs and fed him honey. The forest was the best shelter from his enemies.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;sup&gt;[Riordan, J. &quot;Russian Fairy Tales and Their Collectors.&quot; [http://books.google.com]](http://books.google.com/books?id=EDvKpNzNBD0C)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; It's notable how closely intertwined honey and their ideals of paradise were, as found by a search for the term &quot;honey&quot; in [&quot;The Paradise Myth in Eighteenth-century Russia: Utopian Patterns in Early Secular Russian Literature and Culture&quot;](http://books.google.com/books?id=C46rAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=honey#v=snippet&amp;q=honey&amp;f=false) (Baehr, S. L.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, though still conjecture, it may be so that Russian culture has had a higher demand for honey notes in their foods and beverages, naturally selecting those tastes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Frankly, it may simply be the case that there's not an objective (&quot;provable&quot;) answer to this question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/medovukha/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://russian.lingualift.com/blog/honey-tradition-russia/" />

Nothing in there *appears* to prevent brewers from filling any growler, but the standard interpretation from both the ABCC and the brewers is that they believe it makes it illegal for them to fill any growlers other than their own, and that is the policy by which they seem to all operate.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for retail establishments, there do seem to be some non-brewery bars that offer growlers, (see Ducali Pizzeria and Bar on [this list][2]) but those may be for on-premise use.  There was a proposal for a bill to allow on-premise / off-premise licensees to do growler fills but as far as I can tell, it died in committee, primarily due to strong opposition from craft brewers who were worried it would cut into their bottle profits.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Beyond issues of distribution, the joint legislative committee also heard from industry members interested in allowing both on- and off-premise retailers to fill beer containers up to 64 ounces for take-away and off-site consumption. The bill, sponsored by Representative William Pignatelli, has caused some division in the industry between retailers and small brewers. “We think it would be a disaster for our business by cannibalizing our bottle sales, our only real income source,” says one small Massachusetts brewer. “We for one couldn't thrive in a situation where the profit on bottled beer transfers from brewery to store or bar.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: http://www.beveragebusiness.com/archives/article.php?cid=1&amp;eid=88&amp;aid=2031&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.mass.gov/abcc/regulations.htm#LicensesandPermits6&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://growlerdirectory.com/growler-stations/Massachusetts-MA" />

With hundreds (thousands!) of beers in Belgium, Chimay is a popular beer, but far from the most popular. I think that's the reason why they can sell a lot abroad.&#xD;&#xA;Also a fact, beers like Westvleteren (that won a lot of prizes) are even in Belgium (where it is brewed) pretty rare and hard to get. Basically you have to go to the Abbey yourself to get some beer. If you're there, you only get ONE crate (6 beers) per person. I was lucky enough to visit Westvleteren a while ago and found out that in the nearby cafe you also could buy one crate per person, however there were only about 100 crates available that day and only one type was available. You can drink all types though by ordering it to drink in the café (3 types).&#xD;&#xA;If you would ever want to taste Westvleteren but cannot find it, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 is a very similar beer.

Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn't hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn't confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to &quot;sessionize&quot; and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20  I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that's more like a carbonated lemonade than what we'd think of as soda.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to their reputation, if you'll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel's and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn't ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren't even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they'll become more accepted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer." />

Beer is technically not distilled. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the definition you cited says, beer is the product of fermenting sugar derived from cereal grain which is dissolved in water. So water + grain + yeast = beer. The grain has to undergo a saccharification process where the carbohydrate chains (starches) in the grain are transformed into sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose...) which is then converted into alcohol by yeast. Fermentable sugar is extracted from barley through [malting][2] and [mashing][3]. The yeast is generally added to the *wort* (unfermented sugary water) manually by the brewer or wild yeast can fall into the beer from the air. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other processes may be involved with fermenting other grains. For example, in sake brewing, [koji][4] (a type of mold) is grown on rice (and soybeans) before fermentation in order to convert starches into fermentable sugars, as rice does not contain the enzymes needed to convert its starches into sugars (note: sake is generally not consider beer, but there are beers made with significant quantities of rice, up to 100% rice beer is possible).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hops is not a necessary ingredient in beer, and beer was made for thousands of years before people started adding hops to it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These strong beers like Snake Venom are generally brewed to this high ABV level through freeze &quot;distillation.&quot; This isn't really distillation, because no heat is involved, so people still call them beers. But this is a concentration process similar to distillation. Alcohol has a lower freezing point than water, so when you freeze beer, you can remove the ice and you're left with a more concentrated beer. This is the process used in the German eisbock style. The brewers also start with a high ABV beer, using special ingredients (sugar sources other than malt, like table sugar) along with strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol and still continue to live and ferment. This process can be somewhat difficult and expensive, so it gets attention. In my opinion it's a novelty, but I guess people like it, because they sell a lot of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_%28beer%29&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/05/making-koji-for-sake.html" />

Necessity may also play a part (Given a choice between a warm beer vs no beer it depends how thirsty you are!).  &#xD;&#xA;German-style lagers are almost exclusively recommended to be served no lower than 6C no higher than 9C, but I often find that the last (and warmest) mouthfuls from a glass actually have the most flavour - but I would always start with the lager cold when possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Real ales are a different story. On the continent of Europe there still seems to be a myth that British drink their beer 'luke-warm', but if served at that temperature most Brits would complain (and maybe continue to drink it while complaining). I believe the phrase 'serve cool' rather than 'cold' applies. Some live, bottled beers actually suffer from being too cold. On of my favourites, Black Sheep Ale develops a 'chill haze' - going a little cloudy if left in the fridge too long. 13C is about right for such beers.&#xD;&#xA;Reference the book Beer For Dummies!" />

Snifters are widely used for beer and generally for two reasons, in my experience.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. As you suspect, the bowl shaped glass helps to concentrate the aroma.  However, this isn't unique to the snifter as many types of beer glasses incorporate a narrowing throat to provide this effect. &#xD;&#xA; 2. Quantity.  With a glass of beer that has a particularly high alcohol content, or particularly strong flavor, you'll often get much less than a standard 12-16 oz. pour.  The beer you refer to for instance, the Big Bad Baptist, has an alcohol content of 11.8% ABV, which closer to wine than beer, (and wine has a standard 5oz serving size per glass, or thereabouts) so it calls for a smaller serving size.  However, a 5oz or 6oz serving would look rather silly in a pint glass, so a snifter is more appropriate in proportion. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; " />

Unfiltered beers like real ale have much more yeast in suspension, and yeast has a tendency to make you gassy when digested.  Lager in general has very little yeast due to the long, cold, aging process.  I believe commercial examples are filtered as well.  In general most commercial beers are filtered, or at least have had the yeast killed off somehow, which mitigates the effect.  Real ale's major selling points are that it's unpasteurized and unfiltered, and is refermented in the cask...so it's basically got way more yeast and way more active yeast than other kinds of beer.  And then cask ales are served from a tap at the front near the bottom...near the yeast.  Basically the perfect storm of fart-induction." />

Most popular with everyone I know is home-made strawberry wine, but plum wine is a favourite, too, and any berry or fruit is used, with every family that owns a garden making one or two bottles of these fruit wines each autumn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apples are different because we grow so much more of them than strawberries or plums, and they are regularly pressed into apple juice in large quantities by the fruit grower cooperatives that sell it to the beverage industry. If you don't pasteurize the juice (for long term stability), it turns alcoholic after a couple of days, and after the apple harvest everyone gets large cannisters of freshly pressed juice from the cooperative presses, bakes onion tarts (&quot;Dinnele&quot;), and eats and drinks this seasonal speciality, with more or less alchohol, depending on taste.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Most&quot; ([must][7]) or &quot;Süßmost&quot; (sweet must) is freshly pressed juice; once it has turned alcoholic (and sour) it has different names in different areas, such as &quot;Sauermost&quot; (sour must) and [Apfelwein][8] (apple wine).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Within southern Germany and Austria, Frankfurt is not specifically famous for apple wine, the drink, because it is drunk elsewhere, too. What the region around Frankfurt is somewhat well-known for are the festivities surrounding the end of the apple harvest and the pessing of apple juice, which have been the background theme for a musical tv show, [Zum Blauen Bock][9] (The Blue Goat Buck), that ran from 1957 to 1987.

The foam can add to both the flavor and the texture of your beer.  It is preference for sure, and if you don't like it, then you don't like it, but I'd encourage you to try it from time to time with an open mind.  The head of a beer is quite complex, consisting of proteins that are acted on by the hops, the yeast, and the carbonation. Because of the complexity, creating the perfect recipe for foam in a beer is something the brewers spend quite a lot of time and energy on, and it's a fairly integral part of a good beer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that there are exceptions. Truly non-carbonated beer, like Samuel Adams Utopias will not have a head. Hever, from what I've read, that specific example is probably more closely comparable to a fortified wine than a common beer in any case.  " />

You can call and make an appointment and IF you get an&#xD;&#xA;    appointment then you must drive there at the appointed time to pick&#xD;&#xA;    up your crate of bier.

I&#xD;&#xA;    forget how much bier this is for, but I think it is 24-48 bottles. Indeed when you make the appointment then you must supply your license place number which they use to keep track of you. They will not allow you to make 2 appointments with the same license plate number in a 60 day period. Additionally, the phone number you must call to get an appointment is always busy, I have heard of people using automatic redial for hours before they finally get through. &#xD;&#xA; 2. If you are in the area (again you will need a car, because there is no public transport, and biking there is unreasonable from most places.) You can pop in and there is a small shop next to the monastery where you can buy a 6 pack per person without appointment, and also with out a huge price markup. Of course while you are there you can also eat some good food, and buy other items that the monks make and sell. This is much less hassle, but you cannot get much bier, so it may not be worth trekking all the way out there specifically for this.  However if you are in the area already and you have the time to take a small detour then you should certainly pop in for lunch or dinner and get some tasty brew.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Finally if you are in the Benelux region you can sometimes find Westvleteren in local shops or cafes, however the prices range from 10-16 euros per bottle (in Amsterdam) which is a lot more than you will pay at the monastery.

You said it's a home built system, yes?  So is this a mini-fridge conversion, chest freezer/keezer conversion, or some other kit?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, what length are the beer lines?  Generally you need to balance CO2 pressure against beer lines to avoid consistently foamy pours.  If your system isn't properly balanced the beer will always be foamy, on every pour.  I have 5-6 foot lines in my kegerator and it works pretty well for me, when I was having foamy pour problems everyone suggested replacing them with 10 foot lines just to make damn sure the pour wasn't too violent.  Also making sure the lines are clean.  Any beer stone or other sediment in the lines is going to cause foam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Serving warmer with lower CO2 would also be a better step.  One frustrating thing about these sorts of adjustments is that it takes time for equilibrium to be hit.  So if you lower the CO2 pressure, the headspace is still pressurize.  You'll need to vent the keg via the pressure release valve.  Same deal with raising the temperature.  Once the beer actually comes up to the new temp, there will have been CO2 driven out of solution that you need to vent from the headspace via the pressure release valve.  It's a pain.  Regulators will also often have their own pressure valve, which you should poke and vent slightly when setting the pressure...especially when coming down since excess pressure in the system is going to mess with the reading.  So vent, watch it rise to the actual pressure, then adjust, vent again, and watch.  It takes some time but generally once you set it there's very little change required.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's hard to tell without seeing the speed of your pour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Definitely check the keg temperature itself.  As a homebrewer I reuse kegs, so I have stickers on all my kegs that have a little temperature line.  These liquid crystal thermometers, like [this one][1], are pretty cheap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also check the ambient temperature using a regular thermometer and a small glass of water.  You should check temperature at multiple spots inside the kegerator, so you could fill some tumblers or shot glasses with water and place them at the bottom of the kegerator, then maybe on top of the keg, and then maybe a back shelf if you have anything like that.  This lets you know if you have any hot spots which you can reduce by reorganizing tubes or tossing a small computer case fan in there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, if you haven't disabled the dome light in the fridge, do so or find some way to make sure the switch stays down beyond a doubt.  When I first built my kegerator I was getting incredibly foamy pours and a huge contributor wound up being the dome light kept coming on and heating up the tops of the kegs and the beer in my lines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another final check is the temperature inside of the tower.  If you have no way for the cold air to get from the body of the fridge into the tower the lines in the tower will get warm and cause foamy beer, though if the CO2 pressure is set correctly, this would likely only result in the first 1-2 pours being foamy, then it calms down until the lines warm back up.  A lot of people will put fans or run copper tubes up the towers.  I filled mine with insulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/Exo-Terra-Liquid-Crystal-Thermometer/dp/B00026Z4PS/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398947179&amp;sr=8-3-fkmr0&amp;keywords=keg%20temperature%20strip &quot;this one&quot;" />

Brewers, like any other businesses, like for the general public to know that the anonymous tapped beer you're drinking is theirs.  That is why they provide branded glasses to bars, and request (or require) that their beer be served in their glasses.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Is there a benefit to the mildly curved shape of this glass for this type of beer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my observations, yes, there is.  While the throat may not narrow as severely as a brandy snifter, the effect of concentrating the aroma is still achieved. Eyeballing it, I'd say that the curvature is somewhere in between that of my champagne flutes and my red wines glasses, which are presumed to have the same general effect.  More generally I'd say that a glass with a narrowing or restricted throat does concentrate the aroma, and the degree of restriction doesn't seem to matter significantly, to my nose.  (Assuming it isn't *too* great, that is.  Beer in a bottle or can, for instance, is definitely at a disadvantage.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd like to also look at a few of the reasons they state in their marketing material as well.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The authentic shape of the body encourages the perfect balance of C02 and liquid, enhancing head retention and flavor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't have any evidence to back this up, but I suspect that this is probably the most legitimate of the claims.  This would have a significant effect on the experience of drinking the beer, it is going to be specific to their recipe, and it's a reason that's often given for custom beer glassware.  (Boston Beer Company laser etches the bottom of their Sam Adams Boston Lager glass to enhance cavitation, for instance.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The angles at the bottom cause a wave that works in harmony with the liquid alchemy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have no idea what this means.  Alchemy is the term for pre-chemistry, and primarily deals with trying to turn ordinary substances into gold.  I assume they're trying to insinuate that the glass magically turns Stella into better beer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The stem provides a means to hold the chalice so that the Stella Artois stays cold longer &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is plausible, and perhaps unfortunate.  This is why you are supposed to hold red wine glasses by the bowl (to warm the wine) and white wine glasses by the stem (to keep it cool.)   However, with wine, a serving is generally five ounces or so, compared to twelve or more of lager.   The effect certainly won't be the same given the significantly higher mass.   The unfortunate bit is that colder is not generally what you want when you're talking about good beer.  Colder is the realm of the cheap macro-brews like Coors Light.   Cold subdues flavor compounds, which is useful when the flavor of the beer is nasty, and not so useful when it's pleasant.  This certainly isn't a a requirement or general best practice for lagers as you won't find stemmed glassware used for Boston Beer's Samuel Adams Lager glass: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Samuel Adams Boston Lager Glass][1] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or my classic Spiegelau Lager glass: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Speieglau lager glass][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or any of the glasses you'll see used for the many fine Lagers of Germany.  So, I have to suppose one of the following two reasons.  First, they may simply be pandering to the general belief that colder beer is better.  Second, it would be unfortunate if they were trying to hide a lack of quality by trying to ensure the beer was too cold to taste properly.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, and I've left this to last, because it's purely my opinion...I think they've chosen the chalice glass specifically because it's fancy, and that's the image they want to portray for their beer.  When people see the Stella glass, they don't want their beer to be lumped in with the pint-glass styles, they want it to stand out as sophisticated, and the chalice specifically gives it that cachet.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, my top line and bottom line are down to marketing, with a bit of truth and a bit of fiction to all the bits in between. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/DMcwF.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wn6wv.png" />

In London (UK) we have a brewery producing a 2.8% abv beer (Redemption brewery, beer name escapes me) which is packed with hops and of greater hop depth than many IPAs. Batches of a beer that are brewed to be low alcohol will necessarily be different to those brewed at full strength which is why I would hope (pray?) that any brewer whose product is worth drinking would make a different beer, brewed at low strength for these markets. These beers can be as flavoursome and exciting as, if not more so than, higher strength beers.&#xD;&#xA;The process to make the beer lower ABV is simply reducing the amount of sugar that can be converted into alcohol by using a lower sugar content mash either using specific lower sugar malts, using less malt, or using a yeast that will not support higher alcohol concentrations (alcohol kills yeast...!). Using less yeast won't work as the given yeast will continue to multiply to make up the shortfall. If you are not making real beer halting the fermentation early by killing the yeast with heat (or similar) will produce a lower alcohol beer but it will be sweeter as there is more unfermented sugar. Fining and serving real ale before fermentation has produced a higher strength may have a similar effect for those types of beer.&#xD;&#xA;Since alcohol dissolves flavouring compounds better than water it is much harder to brew a highly flavoured weak beer *but* this may be offset by taste complexity.&#xD;&#xA;Larger breweries will reduce alcohol levels chemically post-production by boiling off alcohol or similar. this will reduce the flavouring compounds in the beer (see GCSE fractional distillation notes or similar for details) and so make the beer taste weaker. These are produced at mass market quantities and even the full strength product is pretty awful compared with crafted or real beers." />

Focusing on lactobacillus, which is your common bacteria used in cheese making, lactobacillus can introduce more lactic acid into the beer. This anaerobic bacteria is more active either before fermentation has started (either by contamination or inoculation) and after fermentation has ended.

The prices are wholesale price so cheaper than they would be in a store so that they make a profit.&#xD;&#xA;I help to run a beer festival in the UK and we tend to order out beers from an distributors or direct from the brewery (we know most of the 50+ breweries in London well enough that a few donate some barrels as well as we are a not for profit organization).

Assuming you are referring to Becks Premium Lager (as opposed to one of their other offerings), Becks has an IBU (International Bitterness Units) of 20 where Heineken has 23 IBUs.  Based on IBUs, Heineken should be more bitter but not by much.  What you're tasting could be accounted for by batch to batch variation on behalf of the brewer or the conditions that the bottles were stored (length of storage, lighting, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, the bitterness in most of Becks' beers come from the use of darker malts, while the majority of the bitterness in Heineken comes from the use of (pellet) hops. &#xD;&#xA;This makes the bitterness in Becks tend towards roastier flavors, and the bitterness in Heineken to tend to be more herbaceous or floral. It is possible that you are more personally sensitive to one set of those flavor compounds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that IBUs are an imperfect measurement of bitterness so only consider it as an approximation.  Many people say that differences in bitterness beyond 100 IBUs are indiscernible but that is often conflicted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Answered by: the Gastrograph Team" />

You can have a beer with a larger number of IBUs but also a large amount of residual sweetness such as caramel malts) and this will generally taste sweeter than a beer that has a lower IBUs and almost no residual sweetness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each brewer designs a beer with a taste profile in mind, and then seeks ingredients and sometimes process changes to arrive at this desired flavor profile. This often requires several iterations until the desired result is reached, and even then it may not be possible to reach it every time, so the brewer may also choose to blend beers from different batches to arrive close to the desired result. The same is true for Heineken - their Quality Assurance team will have been given clear guidelines on the spec for the beer, both as hard and fast measurable, objective facts (IBUs, Color, carbonation, diacetyl, fusel alcohols, esters etc...) and also as subjective - how it tastes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the final answer about why one beer is more bitter than another is because their respective breweries have decided that's the flavor they want, and they have crafted a brew to produce their chosen flavor profile.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

One alternative would be to replace the air with an inert gas (perhaps with a product like [Private Preserve][1]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To minimise loss of carbonation, you really only need to reseal the bottle so it is airtight: carbon dioxide will stop coming out of solution once the pressure builds.

The company did not spend sufficient time testing the new process, and tiny green flakes appeared in the beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Internet sleuthing reveals [this *Beer Connoisseur* article][3], which gives more info and claims that the flakes were, in fact, white:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Schlitz decided to use another beer stabilizer instead, one that would be filtered out of the final product and thus would not have to be listed as among the ingredients. Unfortunately, what Schlitz's brewing technicians did not know was that the new anti-haze agent, called Chill-garde, would react in the bottles and cans with the foam stabiliser they also used, to cause protein to settle out. At its best this protein looked liked tiny white flakes floating in the beer and at its worst it looked like mucus, or &quot;snot,&quot; as one observer bluntly called it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After more research, I can't find any other references to Schlitz being [literally] green.

I have the following hypotheses:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *Beer Connoisseur* also mentions that Schlitz switched from whole to pellet hops; coupled with inadequate filtration, this could have led to green flakes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Adults doing research thought of &quot;snot&quot; like kids, which meant that a &quot;snotlike&quot; substance in beer was probably green.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* This is a misunderstanding created by non-brewers reading that Schlitz was &quot;green&quot; (which does appear frequently in search results); combined with knowing that there were flakes, and that the liquid of beer is generally amber-ish, it must have been [to someone unfamiliar with &quot;green beer&quot; being beer which needs to be further aged] that the flakes were literally green.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *Beer Connoisseur* is wrong, and the flakes were in fact green.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does anyone have first-hand experience with this era of beer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(this is crossposted from [the Homebrewing channel)][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/12438/confirm-refute-green-schlitz-myth&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://books.google.com/books?id=xe7Ye5bw8wgC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=schlitz%20hit%20the%20fan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P7scBc9ggZ&amp;sig=hYi3R5FykZWjVvbwTmYbbBVlxoY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fZ2WU-OUNM3eoATA8ICwBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=schlitz%20hit%20the%20fan&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.beerconnoisseur.com/the-fall-of-schlitz" />

Somewhat surprisingly, a lot of new-ish pubs and bars will actually be provided with very low cost or even free beer (or other alcohol) on the condition that only that brand will be on tap for *x* amount of months/years. This generally happens with bigger breweries. Pubs also will sometimes *sell* taps to breweries. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of cost, no, it wouldn't be cheaper for a pub to go the the local liquor store and buy the beer there (might be 20%+ more expensive). When a brewery sells to a organization (pub, restaurant, liquor store etc.) it is generally at a 18-26% discount so that it can then be marked up by the pubs at a reasonable price.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A lot of this is the same sort of way that pubs get their chicken wings, just more heavily regulated." />

The prices are wholesale price so cheaper than they would be in a store so that they make a profit.&#xD;&#xA;I help to run a beer festival in the UK and we tend to order our beers from distributors or direct from the brewery (we know most of the 50+ breweries in London well enough that a few donate some barrels as well as we are a not for profit organization). A distributor works partially as a broker between breweries and buyers and partially as a wholesaler, the difference is that they tend to keep the beer at the brewery and only pick it up and transport it to fulfill an order. One of the distributors that we use is FlyingFirkin http://www.flyingfirkin.co.uk/ , just to give you some idea of how it works.&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, in the UK, duty is paid at point of sale so VAT is paid on the beer when it is bought from the supplier but duty is only applied when it is sold to the end user, or &quot;drinker&quot;, and so the price paid from the supplier will be significantly lower." />

The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck's is wholly owned by AB InBev.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.  The flavor is very light and dry with only slight malty sweetness.  A little crisp hop bitterness without too much hop aroma.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most &quot;macrobrews&quot; will be somewhat similar, though the stock &quot;American&quot; variant of Pale Lager like Budweiser or Miller will have a corn sugar flavor to them and likely be a bit lighter in body.  Beck's claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it's a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it's in the Pilsner style so while it's still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.  Pilsners also have a strong hop character and bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you wanted to try local or American brewed versions just about anyone's Session Lager (Full Sail comes to mind, as does Notch if you're near MA at all) should be similar.  According to [this list][1] on BeerAdvocate you should be near Berghoff and Baderbrau which will both make traditional German styles.  Some breweries, Baderbrau included, will call their pale lager a &quot;Lawnmower beer&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Branching out, Sam Adams Boston Lager is a style called Vienna Lager which may also appeal you.  Though it will be significantly maltier than Beck's.  Anything with Dortmunder in the name will also be similar, though hoppier but not like an American Pale Ale or IPA or anything.  You might also be interested in any brewery's Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch's are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does that help?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/6/" />

I personally can forgive this, since pears are closely related to apples, and the result is quite tasty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;beer&quot; part of ginger beer is due to the fermentation process involved in its creation.  In this way, it is more similar to &quot;root beer&quot;, since ginger is a root, like the sassafras root used in root beer and birch roots used in birch beer.  The website todayifoundout.com has a well referenced article for [Why Root Beer is Called That](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/why-root-beer-is-called-that/) covering the naming of root beer.  If the ginger based version isn't fermented, but is instead ginger flavouring added to carbonated water, it would be &quot;ginger ale&quot;; I have no idea why, since an India Pale Ale is certainly fermented.  Even with ginger products, the differentiation is not really all that terribly strict, as noted by this [Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/ginger-ale-vs-ginger-beer_n_1438420.html).  Initially, ginger beer, root beer, birch beer, etc, were frequently alcoholic, but Prohibition ruined that for the U.S.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a bit of a side note, the alcoholic versions are making a wonderful comeback (in my personal opinion) with [Sprecher's](https://www.sprecherbrewery.com/hrb.php) and [Small Town Brewery](http://smalltownbrewery.com/?page_id=11) for root beer.  I personally have not seen as much alcoholic ginger beer, but [Crabbies](http://www.crabbiesgingerbeer.co.uk/) from the U.K. is quite good.

Hop aroma may range from none to a light, spicy or floral hop presence. Low levels of yeast character (green apples, DMS, or fruitiness) are optional but acceptable. No diacetyl.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Appearance:** Very pale straw to medium yellow color. White, frothy head&#xD;&#xA;&gt; seldom persists. Very clear.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Flavor:** Crisp and dry flavor with some low levels of grainy or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; corn-like sweetness. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels. Hop&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bitterness at low to medium-low level. Balance may vary from slightly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of carbonation may provide a slight acidity or dry &quot;sting.&quot; No&#xD;&#xA;&gt; diacetyl. No fruitiness.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Mouthfeel:** Light body from use of a high percentage of adjuncts such&#xD;&#xA;&gt; as rice or corn. Very highly carbonated with slight carbonic bite on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the tongue.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Overall Impression:** Very refreshing and thirst quenching.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Comments:** Strong flavors are a fault. An international style including&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the standard mass-market lager from most countries.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Ingredients:** Two- or six-row barley with high percentage (up to 40%)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of rice or corn as adjuncts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some beers bill themselves as a &quot;Pale Ale&quot;, like Rolling Rock also use adjuncts, like rice.  This notation is designed to set them apart from those other beers.  It should be noted that the BJCP guidelines for a Pale Ale are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Aroma:** Usually moderate to strong hop aroma from dry hopping or late&#xD;&#xA;&gt; kettle additions of American hop varieties. A citrusy hop character is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; very common, but not required. Low to moderate maltiness supports the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty&#xD;&#xA;&gt; malt character (bready, toasty, biscuity). Fruity esters vary from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; moderate to none. No diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; notes, although this character should not be excessive.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Appearance:** Pale golden to deep amber. Moderately large white to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear, although&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Flavor:** Usually a moderate to high hop flavor, often showing a citrusy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; American hop character (although other hop varieties may be used). Low&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to moderately high clean malt character supports the hop presentation,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (bready, toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hops and bitterness, but the malt presence can be substantial. Caramel&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flavors are usually restrained or absent. Fruity esters can be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; moderate to none. Moderate to high hop bitterness with a medium to dry&#xD;&#xA;&gt; finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into the finish. No&#xD;&#xA;&gt; diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; character should not be excessive.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Mouthfeel:** Medium-light to medium body. Carbonation moderate to high.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Overall smooth finish without astringency often associated with high&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hopping rates.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Overall Impression:** Refreshing and hoppy, yet with sufficient&#xD;&#xA;&gt; supporting malt.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Comments:** There is some overlap in color between American pale ale and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; American amber ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have a less caramelly malt profile, less body, and often more&#xD;&#xA;&gt; finishing hops.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **History:** An American adaptation of English pale ale, reflecting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; indigenous ingredients (hops, malt, yeast, and water). Often lighter&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in color, cleaner in fermentation by-products, and having less caramel&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flavors than English counterparts.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Ingredients:** Pale ale malt, typically American two-row. American hops,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; often but not always ones with a citrusy character. American ale&#xD;&#xA;&gt; yeast. Water can vary in sulfate content, but carbonate content should&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be relatively low. Specialty grains may add character and complexity,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that add malt flavor and richness, light sweetness, and toasty or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bready notes are often used (along with late hops) to differentiate&#xD;&#xA;&gt; brands.&#xD;&#xA;" />

There's no brewing (boiling) stage necessary in making mead. All of the fermentable sugar comes from the honey in mead, so you just mix honey with water (and whatever spices you want) and go directly to the fermenting stage.

I really love Heady Topper and I haven't yet had another DIPA that tastes similar. First, it's not that expensive. It's $3.75 for a 16 oz can. $14 for a 4-pack. You can get it at local bars, pubs, and restaurants for $5/can. Around $78 for a case (24 x 16oz cans). Compared to other DIPA of similar quality, it's not that expensive (sure if you compared it to macro lagers...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's produced by a small family owned brewery that's went through 2 expansions which doubled their brewery in size each time over the last 2 years (cannery has only existed for 2 years, before that they brewed it at a brewpub until the brewpub was destroyed by Hurricane Irene). They are currently getting their paperwork finalized for construction of a second brewery which will expand their production even more than before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For locals, it's not that difficult to acquire. If you visit Vermont and plan ahead, then you're sure to leave with a case or two.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it's worth trading for, but just remember that there's no beer that's life changing. Just a lot of really good tasting beer.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Text="Yes, there are craft breweries in Iceland. There aren't that many, but with a population of only 300,000 people that's to be expected. The main ones are Einstök, Borg, Gædingur, and Ölvisholt. There's also Stedji and Kaldi, but these are less interesting. I felt Gædingur was a bit variable on quality. Note that none of these produce extreme beers. They focus more on drinkability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Only Borg is in Reykjavik. I don't know if you can visit the brewery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can't buy interesting beer in Icelandic supermarkets, because the alcohol limit is 2.25%. As far as I could tell, only 4 beers were available in supermarkets, all of them pale lagers. You have to go to Vinbudin. There's a branch in the Austurstræti in the city centre, but the one out in the Kringlan shopping center has a bigger selection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look for these bars in the Reykjavik city centre: Micro Bar, Cafe Laundromat, K-Bar, and 73. All of them on Austurstræti and Laugarvegur.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Edit:* I forgot to say what's the most unique/distinct beer. I'd say Borg Fenrir, which they describe &quot;tadreyktur IPA&quot;, meaning IPA smoked in the traditional Icelandic way. That is, it's smoked by burning sheep dung. (Seriously.) The smoke aroma is really unusual, but actually quite nice." />

I have a favorite from Mill Street in Canada; they make a great vanilla porter.  The caveat though is that I like coffee a lot, and many people averse to beer tend to have trouble with the intense flavors of different varieties of beer, such as extreme hoppiness, heavily malted barley, or, darkly roasted barley that make up stouts and porters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You mentioned less fruity beers, but talked about &quot;Wild Blue&quot; when you mentioned that.  Wild Blue is a Blueberry flavored lager; it's basically a &quot;regular beer,&quot; but is infused with blueberry flavor to change it up.  I would look at other &quot;fruity&quot; styles that are still very authentic and internationally renowned, but pack less of a general beer flavor than a filtered rice/grain/barley beer would...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A good starter would be a more heavily wheat based beer.  Styles like Belgian wheats or German hefeweizens have less of that pronounced &quot;regular beer&quot; flavor, but are still in their own right, very prolific styles.  I tend to find Belgian wheats/&quot;weisse/wittes(whites)&quot; to be a bit more &quot;chewy&quot; with more of a banana/coriander flavor than their full blown German counterparts.  Good wheats that I would recommend would be Franziskaner or Hoegaarden.  They're safe forays into that style of beer that I almost always tend to get for new drinkers.  The cool thing is that if she likes them, you can really experiment with other varieties in that field.  Belgian doubles and triples tend to generally fall into a similar category, and they're arguably some of the finest beers in the world..." />

Pop the tops, toss in a few hops, re-cap and mark what hop is in each.  Wait a day or two and then taste.  This will highlight the aroma and some of the upfront flavors of the hop more than it's bitterness and will get you familiar with that hop variety.  This does require having a bottle caper and some caps, but those can be bought either at a local homebrew store or online for less than 20 dollars when you purchase the small 1oz bags of hops.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you homebrew, try to brew small brew in a bag batches of 1 gallon to try different hop varieties.

Common bacteria involved are *Pediococcus acidilactici* and and *Lactobacillus* which *Tasting Beer* describes as having a buttery or &quot;goaty, sweat socks&quot; like aroma/flavor.  I think that probably aligns pretty closely with your &quot;musty&quot; description.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is it serious?  In the sense that it can cause illness, no, at least not these organisms.  These are probiotic bacteria similar to what are advertised in some yogurt.  However, given that it does speak poorly to the maintenance routines of this establishment, I wouldn't blame you for not wanting to continue to opt for the draft beer, if for no other reason than that it doesn't taste very good.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, it might be worth a quick friendly word to management.  They may not realize that they need to clean their tap lines more frequently, or not realize that it isn't being done.  It's an easily fixable problem and if they do take steps to fix it, everyone will be better off.  &#xD;&#xA;" />

Zare, the Professor of Natural Sciences at Stanford. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;But countless drinkers have claimed that the bubbles actually go down the side of the glass. Could they be right, or would that defy the laws of physics?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In 1999, Australian researchers announced that they had created a computer model showing it was  possible for beer bubbles to flow downward.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But Zare and former Stanford post doctoral fellow Andrew J. Alexander were unconvinced by the virtual Guinness model and decided to put it to the test by analysing it physically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Indeed, Andy and I first disbelieved this and wondered if the people had had maybe too much Guinness to drink,&quot; Zare recalled. &quot;We tried our own experiments, which were fun but inconclusive. So Andy got hold of a camera that takes 750 frames a second and recorded some rather gorgeous video clips of what was happening.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A careful analysis of the video confirmed findings: Beer bubbles do sink.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;The answer turns out to be really very simple. It's based on the idea of what goes up has to come down. In this case, the bubbles go up more easily in the centre of the beer glass than on the sides because of drag from the walls. As they go up, they raise the beer, and the beer has to spill back, and it does. It runs down the sides of the glass carrying the bubbles -- particularly little bubbles -- with it, downward. After a while it stops, but it's really quite dramatic and it's easy to demonstrate.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The phenomenon also occurred in other beers, said Alexander&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;The bubbles are small enough to be pushed down by the liquid. We've shown you can do this with any liquid, really -- water with a fizzing tablet in it, for example.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;It's just paying attention to the world around you and trying to figure out why things happen the way they do...&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Source][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2004/bubbles317.html" />

I remember going to a tasting of a local's brewers Galaxy IPA and he'd filled the shop with glasses of Galaxy hops and it smelled incredable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another time was tasting a Sorachi Ace beer by Wiper and True. It was horrific, but hearing the descriptions my fellow drinkers came up with and having the brewer explaining the history of the hop really anchored it to me.

European hops are so different from American which are different again from British. Not to mention New Zealand hops which have their own aromas.
